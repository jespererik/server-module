TODO Fix logging calls to actually send to the correct file and
to propagate to higher up loggers
    something like this
        DBLogger logs to Database.log and propagates to
        ServerLogger which logs to ServerLog and propagates to
        SystemLogger which logs to systemLogs and is the root logger
